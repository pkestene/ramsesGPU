	* Version 1.3 : some refactoring in hydrodynamics schemes

	* both CPU and GPU implementation are slightly improved: each of
	them have now 3 versions which varies by the amount of memory required.

2014-11-3 Pierre Kestener
	* Version 1.2 : bug fixes and minor improvements

	* turbulence simulation can now output structure functions computation on-line

	* add numpy file format to dump structure function computation results (easy
	to reload in python)

	* add Fourier power spectrum compution for turbulence simulation analysis

	* update CUDA kernel to use read-only data cache (const restrict)

	* add new initial condition for stratified shearing box problems

	* minor improvements in example parameter files

	* Version 1.1 : bug fixes and features implementation

	* major bug fix: in both CPU / GPU version of the MHD numerical
	scheme, there was a problem in the computation of the
	electromotive force (see file riemann_mhd.h, routine compute_emf)

	* new major feature: refactoring numerical scheme to reduce memory
	footprint. See C++ class suffixed by "ZSlab"; this new
	implementation is the one that must be used for very large
	simulation (ex. 2000^3 for MHD turbulence simulation on Keeneland)

	* new major feature: output using PNetCDF library; restart can
	load a NetCDF file; minor feature: one can output optionnally
	output data on external faces for making movies (output at much
	high frequency than regular output of the entire 3D domain).

	* new feature: new init condition for hydro and MHD turbulence
	application; implementation of a simple forcing term

	* new feature: implement history routine for computing on-line
	analysis quantities (ex: alpha in MRI simulations, Mach number in
	turbulence simulation, ...)

	* new feature: analysis directory containing simple
	post-processing tools adapted to large data files (PNetCDF):
	Fourier power spectrum, slice extraction

	* new minor feature: simple MPI app to convert large file from
	parallel HDF5 to PNetCDF

	* new minor feature: small utility to save data in python numpy files (.npy)

	* new minor feature: some python script for post-processing analysis
	(for data up to 1000^3); for larger data, use tools in the
	analysis sub-directory.

	* fix typo in slope_mhd.h: routine slope_unsplit_hydro_3d for
	slope type = 3

	* new feature: add Riemann solver LLF (Local Lax-Friedrich)

	* new feature: add 2D magnetic Riemann solvers HLLA, HLLF and LLF

	* Version 1.0.1 : bug fixes and minor improvements

	* major bug fix: in the CUDA version of the code, when running the MRI problem, total mass inside box was slightly increasing with time. The bug was fixed in the kernel_mhd_flux_update_hydro_v4_shear CUDA kernel.

	* bug fix: this bug only affects MPI/CUDA version for the RMI problem (wrong index in remapping formula in shear border condition). This bug was causing the simulation run to stop after several 1000's of time steps

	* bug fix in viscosity tensor: affect both CPU/GPU: only one term was slightly false (almost neutral bug)

	* new feature: now GPU memory array can be allocated using pitched or linear memory (before pitched was the default). On new hardware, pitch memory is not anymore a must. Linear memory gives the same performane (thanks to cache improvements). Besides, for a given problem, the amouint of required memory is almost twice smaller when using linear memory, so linear memory is now the default choice.

	* fix MRI history method for MPI run: output was wrong

	* improvement: much better restart procedure; now one can read an HDF5 file at a twice smaller resolution and perform an upscale. This is usefull for MRI problem to restart a job by increasing resolution with a factor of 2.

	* Version 1.0; package name is now RAMSES-GPU with a dedicated website :
	http://www.maisondelasimulation.fr/projects/RAMSES-GPU/html/

	* MRI with both viscous/resistive terms working

2012-3-14 Pierre Kestener

	* Version 0.4.0 is the first version with 3D MHD on CPU/GPU and
	with MHD shearing box capabilities

	* fix bug in MHD time step computation routine (could
	only be seen on large spatial domain causing memory fault)

	* backport unsplit scheme into pure hydro routines

	* improve HDF5/VTK output routines


2011-4-20 Pierre Kestener

	* ChangeLog file was never filled. Let's start !

	* SoftwareName : As 2D MHD solver has been implemented on GPU, let's take the
	opportunity to change the name of the software package from
	HybridHydro to PANAME (PArallel Numerical Algorithms for MHD).
	* Version 0.3.0 is the first version with MHD capabilities (for
	now only 2D on both CPU / GPU has been tested).
